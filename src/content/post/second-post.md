I recently read an article by **Donghee Shin (2025)** titled *“Can AI have a sense of morality?”* It challenges the popular obsession with “programming virtue” into machines and shifts the focus back to where it belongs: **human responsibility**.

As AI systems increasingly participate in life‑and‑death decisions—triage in healthcare, autonomous driving dilemmas (whose life is prioritized: passengers or pedestrians?)—we must confront a simple truth:

**AI doesn’t have a conscience. It has an architecture.**

## Two Key Insights from Shin’s Argument

### 1. The Myth of “Neutral” AI

We often assume that bias can be fully removed from data or algorithms. Shin argues the opposite:  
**bias is a constitutive part of human understanding.**

AI is not a neutral tool; it is a **mirror**.  
If our data is biased, our “ethical AI” will simply: automate, perpetuate, and statistically refine the same inequalities we already have.

### 2. Simulation Is Not Moral Agency

AI can *simulate* ethical behavior through logic, rules, and probability.  
But it cannot: experience empathy, understand moral stakes, or assume responsibility. 

Because AI lacks **intentionality**, the ethical burden cannot be placed on the software. It remains with the developers, the institutions deploying the systems, and the society that governs them.

## The Real Issue: Human Responsibility

We keep waiting for machines to become more human.  
But perhaps the real challenge is for **humans to become more responsible**.

The goal is not to build a “perfectly moral machine.”  
The goal is to build a system where the humans behind the machine are held to:

- higher standards of transparency  
- stronger civic oversight  
- and meaningful accountability

## Questions Worth Reflecting On

1. **How do we build trust in a system that has moral consequences but no moral awareness?**

2. **How do we move from “artificial virtue” to “accountable infrastructure”?**
